(ns run-tests
  "Run the portable half of this actor's suite under nbb (ClojureScript on
  Node via SCI), so the .cljc is checked by the runtime that actually ships
  rather than only by the JVM.

  Coverage is DELIBERATELY partial, and the gap is exact. This repo has two
  test namespaces:

    aftership.main-test  (.cljc) -- portable, listed below
    aftership.kotoba-qualification-test       (.clj) -- JVM-only, NOT listed
    aftership.kotoba-paginate-qualification-test (.clj) -- JVM-only, NOT listed

  The qualification namespaces require kotoba.compiler.core, kotoba.runtime
  and kotoba.wasm-exec to compile src/aftership/page_limit.kotoba and
  src/aftership/paginate.kotoba and execute them on two backends. That
  toolchain is JVM-only, so nbb cannot run it and must not pretend to.

  Measured 2026-09-06 -- the two runtimes agree on the shared namespace:

    clojure -M:test   ->  Ran 8 tests containing 84 assertions
    this runner       ->      6 tests containing 74 assertions

  The difference is exactly the two qualification deftest(s), which is the
  whole of the JVM-only namespaces. If that arithmetic stops holding, one of
  the two runners has silently stopped running something.

  Every namespace is listed explicitly on purpose: clojure -M:test finds
  namespaces by scanning the test directory, but a cljs runner does not, so
  a namespace omitted here would never run and nothing would say so.
